# Pattern Image

This directory contains the pattern image used for background textures in the Little Lemon website.

## Files
- `pattern.svg`: A scalable vector graphic pattern that can be used as a subtle background texture
- `pattern.png`: A rasterized version of the pattern for better browser compatibility
- `README.md`: A guide to creating and using the pattern image

## Usage

The pattern is used in CSS as a background image with low opacity to create a subtle textured effect.

Example CSS:
```css
.element {
  background-image: url('images/pattern.png');
  background-repeat: repeat;
  opacity: 0.05;
}
```

## Regenerating the PNG

If you need to regenerate the PNG file from the SVG:
1. Open the SVG in an image editor
2. Export as PNG with transparent background
3. Save as `pattern.png` in this directory

## Customization

To change the pattern:
1. Edit the `pattern.svg` file
2. Update the colors and shapes as needed
3. Regenerate the PNG if necessary
4. Update the CSS opacity values to achieve the desired effect

## README

This is a placeholder pattern image. In a real application, you would replace this with an actual pattern image.

To create a pattern image:
1. Create a small image (e.g., 10x10px or 20x20px) with a subtle pattern
2. Save it as a transparent PNG
3. Use it in your CSS with background-repeat: repeat

Example CSS:
```css
.element {
  background-image: url('/images/pattern.png');
  background-repeat: repeat;
  opacity: 0.05;
}
```

For now, this file serves as a placeholder to prevent build errors.
